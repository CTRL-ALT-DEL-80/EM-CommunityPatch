* **Ignott - Bring Oracle two artifacts**: Scout GT now can't be destroyed when not driving it. Automatic refuelling is disabled, the car can only be refuelled semi-manually, by visiting the same area where the player initially finds it. Fixed softlock, which could have happened if the player managed to collect the artifacts without changing their car to Scout GT, but then switched to Scout GT. Script which blocks vehicle switch now takes this situation into account and will not be deactivated prematurely [[#199]](https://github.com/DeusExMachinaTeam/EM-CommunityPatch/pull/199) [[#249]](https://github.com/DeusExMachinaTeam/EM-CommunityPatch/pull/249)
* **Argen - Go to the Monastery**: added quest item reward for quest replacing non-existing trigger game tries to activate [[#67]](https://github.com/DeusExMachinaTeam/EM-CommunityPatch/pull/67)
* **Vahat - Deliver oil to Kef**: fixed player's vehicle switch in Kef to Lorry with trailer and back, all towns in the area are closed and the race can't be started while the quest is in progress to prevent softlocks. Players will also be blocked from going to Krai or Zarmek while driving the Lorry to prevent softlocks, fixed bugged cutscene on refusal to travel to other location. Lorry's trailer now has the same skin as the Lorry itself [[#54]](https://github.com/DeusExMachinaTeam/EM-CommunityPatch/pull/54) [[#254]](https://github.com/DeusExMachinaTeam/EM-CommunityPatch/pull/254) [[#372]](https://github.com/DeusExMachinaTeam/EM-CommunityPatch/pull/372)
* **Vahat - Catch up with the specialist**: fix for the music not stopping if the player lets the engineer go, adds immortal mode for him to prevent his kill on save/load. Main character now tells specialist to go northwest, instead of southeast, as is logical for his goal to reach Krai [[#249]](https://github.com/DeusExMachinaTeam/EM-CommunityPatch/pull/249) [[#296]](https://github.com/DeusExMachinaTeam/EM-CommunityPatch/pull/296)

* **Vahat - Race**: fixed player's vehicle switch to Turbo GT and back. Main vehicle will now immediately get teleported to the predefined point, instead of crashing into the wall. Improved finish cutscene, made race position counting reliable, added message on passing a wrong checkpoint [[#54]](https://github.com/DeusExMachinaTeam/EM-CommunityPatch/pull/54) [[#372]](https://github.com/DeusExMachinaTeam/EM-CommunityPatch/pull/372) [[#395]](https://github.com/DeusExMachinaTeam/EM-CommunityPatch/pull/395)
* **Zarmek - Talk to the Scientist**: fixed bug that was making dialogue with Vasiliy 'The Scientist' to an endless loop, even after the player made their choice. Fixed bug that was making player invincible after the first look at 'Njeri object' [[#249]](https://github.com/DeusExMachinaTeam/EM-CommunityPatch/pull/249) [[#372]](https://github.com/DeusExMachinaTeam/EM-CommunityPatch/pull/372)
* **General**: for every quest in the game added quest markers for points of interest: enemies, friendly vehicles that player needs to defend, location that player needs to drive to etc. Including: both gladiators in Colosseum in both story and optional quests, archeologists and raiders in optional quest in Ridzin, bandits at the Quarry(miners' village), the bandits at the oil mine, the bandits at the camp where Stranger is running away, NPT vehicles guarding prison caravan, robots spawned when visiting the lair for the first time, enemies attacking the village in Librium, Monster in Ignott, bandit at the Area 51 (storylines with and w/o Lisa), CD vehicles in 'Set the tunnel free', CD's general convoy, Axel's Belaz, Lisa's Scout in different missions, Felix when player takes revenge on him and when fighting with him again later on, the bandits who ambushed Lisa, rebels in Argen, leaders of CIT in CD mission [[#254]](https://github.com/DeusExMachinaTeam/EM-CommunityPatch/pull/254)

### Locations / Maps
* **Town exits**: fixed exit paths for following towns: Porto(Ridzin), Area 51(Vaterland), Helvetia(Librium), First and Seth(Sacred Grove). The original exit paths could have damaged the vehicle on an exit or even destroy it [[#69]](https://github.com/DeusExMachinaTeam/EM-CommunityPatch/pull/69) [[#295]](https://github.com/DeusExMachinaTeam/EM-CommunityPatch/pull/295)
* **Relaxed passmaps**: removes a lot of instances of 'invisible walls', leaving them in places where they guard against game breaking bugs and softlocks [[#314]](https://github.com/DeusExMachinaTeam/EM-CommunityPatch/pull/314) [[#431]](https://github.com/DeusExMachinaTeam/EM-CommunityPatch/pull/431)
* **Travel to map refusal cutscenes**: added little cutscenes shown when player refuses or can't go to the other map for the following routes: Hel - Vaterland, Sacred Grove - Librium, Sacred Grove - Ignott, Argen - Librium [[#372]](https://github.com/DeusExMachinaTeam/EM-CommunityPatch/pull/372)
* **Krai - Dynamic objects, Grass**: slightly moved and grounded some of the dynamic objects that were floating in the air to look more natural and prevent some graphical artifacts. Fixed some instances of 'floating' grass [[#288]](https://github.com/DeusExMachinaTeam/EM-CommunityPatch/pull/288) [[#312]](https://github.com/DeusExMachinaTeam/EM-CommunityPatch/pull/312) [[#313]](https://github.com/DeusExMachinaTeam/EM-CommunityPatch/pull/313)
* **Ridzin - Terrain**: small terrain fix near stone arch located next to Olympus [[#234]](https://github.com/DeusExMachinaTeam/EM-CommunityPatch/pull/234)
* **Vaterland - Optimisation**: removed a part of trees to reduce the pressure on overloaded object container on this map [[#366]](https://github.com/DeusExMachinaTeam/EM-CommunityPatch/pull/366)
* **Vaterland - Roads**: fixed strange road transitions from one type of tarmac to another between Pesht and Minin [[#402]](https://github.com/DeusExMachinaTeam/EM-CommunityPatch/pull/402)
* **Vaterland - The Amusement Center**: instead of continuing to burn endlessly, fire at The Amusement Center will now be extinguished when a player trips one of the predetermined story checkpoints. Fire triggers also take into consideration if a player had spoken with Manny at The Amusement Center and tried to solve a riddle [[#76]](https://github.com/DeusExMachinaTeam/EM-CommunityPatch/pull/76)
* **Vaterland - Shore line**: added a tidal bore to the lake near Lost village. It isn't physically correct but looks better than without it [[#197]](https://github.com/DeusExMachinaTeam/EM-CommunityPatch/pull/197)
* **Vaterland - Entrance to Asgard**: increased small radius of entrance location for Asgard [[#421]](https://github.com/DeusExMachinaTeam/EM-CommunityPatch/pull/421)
* **Hel - Shore line**: removed a tidal bore for swamp-like water bodies and near the bridge [[#251]](https://github.com/DeusExMachinaTeam/EM-CommunityPatch/pull/251)
* **Hel - Lootbox location**: lootbox spawned at SecretPlace13_loc location can now be reached by the player, previously was inside the invisible walls [[#145]](https://github.com/DeusExMachinaTeam/EM-CommunityPatch/pull/145)
* **Hel - Humans near Olme**: people walking near Olme will now less often get teleported to the roof of the town. This still can happen because of a flawed game engine mechanic [[#146]](https://github.com/DeusExMachinaTeam/EM-CommunityPatch/pull/146)
* **Librium - Travel to Sacred Grove**: player vehicle will face the right direction after the travel [[#199]](https://github.com/DeusExMachinaTeam/EM-CommunityPatch/pull/199)
* **Librium - Entrance to Hideout**: decreased crazy large radius of entrance location for Hideout [[#421]](https://github.com/DeusExMachinaTeam/EM-CommunityPatch/pull/421)

* **Sacred Grove - Travel to Hel**: (Cutscene on travel) submarine will now surface strictly upright, skipping a questionable manoeuvre. Player vehicle will also face the right direction after the travel. Fixed condition for travel, will be blocked from travel in storyline with Lisa [[#199]](https://github.com/DeusExMachinaTeam/EM-CommunityPatch/pull/199) [[#254]](https://github.com/DeusExMachinaTeam/EM-CommunityPatch/pull/254)
* **Ignott - Factory**: added ways out of two dead end factory zones accessible by abusing 'Get out of the difficult place' button [[#252]](https://github.com/DeusExMachinaTeam/EM-CommunityPatch/pull/252)
* **Zarmek - Travel from the scientist base to the map entrance**: player vehicle will face the right direction after the travel [[#249]](https://github.com/DeusExMachinaTeam/EM-CommunityPatch/pull/249)


### Sound
* **Music - Main Menu**: main menu theme will no longer stop playing after watching credits [[#189]](https://github.com/DeusExMachinaTeam/EM-CommunityPatch/pull/189)
* **Weapon - Rainmetal**: fixed sound clipping, loudness is normalised, fire rate gadgets effect is accounted for [[#91]](https://github.com/DeusExMachinaTeam/EM-CommunityPatch/pull/91)
* **Weapon - KPVT**: loudness is normalised [[#233]](https://github.com/DeusExMachinaTeam/EM-CommunityPatch/pull/233)
* **Weapon - Octopus**: loudness is normalised [[#233]](https://github.com/DeusExMachinaTeam/EM-CommunityPatch/pull/233)
* **Weapon - Specter**: loudness is normalised [[#446]](https://github.com/DeusExMachinaTeam/EM-CommunityPatch/pull/446)
* **Vehicle - Turbo GT**: Turbo GT now has an engine sound, which can be heard when racing in Vahat [[#128]](https://github.com/DeusExMachinaTeam/EM-CommunityPatch/pull/128)
* **Soundgroup missmatch**: Moved some sounds to correct sound group for them to be logically controlled by relevant sliders in game UI instead of voice volume slider (reload sound, fire sounds) [[#444]](https://github.com/DeusExMachinaTeam/EM-CommunityPatch/pull/444) [[#447]](https://github.com/DeusExMachinaTeam/EM-CommunityPatch/pull/447)
* **Radio - Adventurers**: fixed one of the aggressive radio messages never playing [[#274]](https://github.com/DeusExMachinaTeam/EM-CommunityPatch/pull/274)

### Balance
* **Gun affixes**: fixed rusty_gun, useless_gun, excellent_gun, advanced_gun affixes affecting Accuracy in the wrong direction, affix price effect added. Made cooling system affixes to correctly affect the price of guns [[#59]](https://github.com/DeusExMachinaTeam/EM-CommunityPatch/pull/59) [[#359]](https://github.com/DeusExMachinaTeam/EM-CommunityPatch/pull/359) [[#362]](https://github.com/DeusExMachinaTeam/EM-CommunityPatch/pull/362)
* **Auto-leveling**: random spawn enemies will now use special prototypes prepared just for them. These prototypes have a limited cargo compartment size to limit a drop of cheap wares caused by limitations of the game's spawn logic. Same fix for the cargo compartment of robots in Sacred Grove. This not only helps with economy balance but also reduces chances of games crashes on "object container" overflow. Enemy Urals will now spawn different wares, same as their smaller counterparts, making them drop not only electronics and bad guns [[#97]](https://github.com/DeusExMachinaTeam/EM-CommunityPatch/pull/97) [[#199]](https://github.com/DeusExMachinaTeam/EM-CommunityPatch/pull/199) [[#237]](https://github.com/DeusExMachinaTeam/EM-CommunityPatch/pull/237) [[#307]](https://github.com/DeusExMachinaTeam/EM-CommunityPatch/pull/307)
* **Radar scan range**: increased player's radar range from 200 to 300 meters, to be more useful for detecting the enemies [[#369]](https://github.com/DeusExMachinaTeam/EM-CommunityPatch/pull/369)
* **Van cab weapon slots**: all three Van cabins now have a 360 gun rotation weapon slots, making all three a valid option for the player [[#173]](https://github.com/DeusExMachinaTeam/EM-CommunityPatch/pull/173)
* **Belaz cargo weapon slot**: adds the second missing Giant weapon slot on Thunder cargo compartment [[#176]](https://github.com/DeusExMachinaTeam/EM-CommunityPatch/pull/176)
* **Hunter cab weapon slot**: limited turning angle of the small gun slot on the second cab [[#174]](https://github.com/DeusExMachinaTeam/EM-CommunityPatch/pull/174)
* **Fighter cab weapon slot**: limited turning angle of the small gun slot on the second cab [[#175]](https://github.com/DeusExMachinaTeam/EM-CommunityPatch/pull/175)
* **Scout GT fuel consumption**: corrected Scout GT fuel consumption to a more sane level(was too high) [[#199]](https://github.com/DeusExMachinaTeam/EM-CommunityPatch/pull/199)
* **Weapon balance**: increased VehicleAIFiringRangeMult, to allow bots to engage in longer distance fights. Added sideguns, rockets, Omega and Hammer to the pool used by AI [Community Remaster only] [[#362]](https://github.com/DeusExMachinaTeam/EM-CommunityPatch/pull/362)
* **Weapon balance - Flag**: reduced count of pellets in a single shot for Flag. Because of questionable design decision, every pellet of Flag's shot creates an explosion wave. If the player is armed with 3 Flags, the number of explosion waves interacting with the physics engine can lead to crash of the game. Flag is still overpowered even after the fix. Changed shotgun firing range from impossible 2 km to 300 m [[#263]](https://github.com/DeusExMachinaTeam/EM-CommunityPatch/pull/263) [[#354]](https://github.com/DeusExMachinaTeam/EM-CommunityPatch/pull/354)
* **Weapon balance - Zeus**: increased Zeus damage, corresponding to unused parameters of its halfs [[#354]](https://github.com/DeusExMachinaTeam/EM-CommunityPatch/pull/354)
* **Weapon economy**: increased prices for overpowered Rainmetal and Flag to provide some wiggle room for auto-spawner to spawn more dangerous enemies. Reduces prices for most energy guns to improve spawner work when player is armed with energy weapon [Community Remaster only] [[#356]](https://github.com/DeusExMachinaTeam/EM-CommunityPatch/pull/356) [[#362]](https://github.com/DeusExMachinaTeam/EM-CommunityPatch/pull/362)
* **Vehicle balance - Torque**: increased engine torque for non-playable small cars, Van, Lorry and early cabins of Ural to counteract stronger gravity of Community Patch [[#319]](https://github.com/DeusExMachinaTeam/EM-CommunityPatch/pull/319)
* **Wares drop**: fixed bug preventing caravans from spawning with scrap metal [[#342]](https://github.com/DeusExMachinaTeam/EM-CommunityPatch/pull/342) 
* **Gadgets**: rebalanced 4 gadgets which changed vehicle 'Control' characteristic, now affecting Structure(Construction) instead of Control [Community Remaster only] (see cleanup entry for MR #282) [[#301]](https://github.com/DeusExMachinaTeam/EM-CommunityPatch/pull/301)

### Content design
* **Enemy spawn zones**: zones that spawn random enemies on the map were rebalanced to reduce chance of enemies spawning on the other side of the map, only to despawn a few seconds later. Made spawn work better with a wider FOV of Community Patch (Krai, Ridzin, Vaterland, Librium) [[#335]](https://github.com/DeusExMachinaTeam/EM-CommunityPatch/pull/335) [[#338]](https://github.com/DeusExMachinaTeam/EM-CommunityPatch/pull/338) [[#343]](https://github.com/DeusExMachinaTeam/EM-CommunityPatch/pull/343) [[#349]](https://github.com/DeusExMachinaTeam/EM-CommunityPatch/pull/349) [[#351]](https://github.com/DeusExMachinaTeam/EM-CommunityPatch/pull/351) [[#352]](https://github.com/DeusExMachinaTeam/EM-CommunityPatch/pull/352) [[#361]](https://github.com/DeusExMachinaTeam/EM-CommunityPatch/pull/361)
* **Faction logos - General**: added new logos for factions which previously lacked unique emblems (Desert dwellers, Nomads, Fishermen, Scientist's defenders, PowerStation(Seil), Serseri) [[#164]](https://github.com/DeusExMachinaTeam/EM-CommunityPatch/pull/164) [[#178]](https://github.com/DeusExMachinaTeam/EM-CommunityPatch/pull/178)
* **Faction affiliation - Hel towns**: all small fishing villages in Hel now belong to Fishermen faction, instead of Free Traders' Alliance [[#164]](https://github.com/DeusExMachinaTeam/EM-CommunityPatch/pull/164)
* **Faction affiliation - Quest 'Kill bandits occupying the warehouse'**: Warehouse will change its affiliation from Brigade to Free Traders' Alliance if you kill the Warehouse guards [[#164]](https://github.com/DeusExMachinaTeam/EM-CommunityPatch/pull/164)
* **Faction affiliation - Quest 'Find and destroy bandits' camp'**: bandit now has a proper Vagabonds affiliation and will be shown as hostile while player follows him to the camp [[#168]](https://github.com/DeusExMachinaTeam/EM-CommunityPatch/pull/168)
* **Faction info - Njeri**: Njeri will show up in the 'Relationship' screen of the journal after the player meets them in person in Librium [[#249]](https://github.com/DeusExMachinaTeam/EM-CommunityPatch/pull/249)
* **Sacred Grove - Quest enemies in 'Block the monsters' lair exit'**: increased the size of the cargo compartment of robots spawned when visiting the lair for the second time, which is needed to fix the loot drop logic. Previously their loot couldn't even fit inside their own cargo compartment. Gameplay wise this means that drop of the loot will not be guaranteed now. Also reduced HP from 2500 to 1500 for auto spawning robots near the lair, but no to the actual quest robots, who will still have 2500 HP [[#199]](https://github.com/DeusExMachinaTeam/EM-CommunityPatch/pull/199) [[#254]](https://github.com/DeusExMachinaTeam/EM-CommunityPatch/pull/254)
* **Vaterland - Quest 'Follow the mayor'**: mayor now has a Hornet, instead of being unarmed [[#249]](https://github.com/DeusExMachinaTeam/EM-CommunityPatch/pull/249)
* **Hel - Boss battle**: if player successfully crosses the swamp while being on Lisa's root, after the death of the boss there is a new check of having a quest that is exclusive for Lisa's root, to prevent player activating the passage to Sacred Grove in place where story shouldn't allow that [[#452]](https://github.com/DeusExMachinaTeam/EM-CommunityPatch/pull/452)
* **Librium - Quest 'Win over Lisa'**: player will not be able to leave the map after starting the fight to prevent softlock. Increased the radius of the trigger location to make it harder for player to miss the quest, taking into account removed invisible walls [[#254]](https://github.com/DeusExMachinaTeam/EM-CommunityPatch/pull/254) [[#385]](https://github.com/DeusExMachinaTeam/EM-CommunityPatch/pull/385)
* **Librium - Boss**: fixed boss fight stages to correctly show boss's health in the battle UI [[#403]](https://github.com/DeusExMachinaTeam/EM-CommunityPatch/pull/403)
* **Ignott - Quest enemy in 'Bring the monster's head'**: increased the size of the cargo compartment of the robot for it to be able to fit his own loot, same as in Sacred Grove. Monster will have 2500 HP [[#199]](https://github.com/DeusExMachinaTeam/EM-CommunityPatch/pull/199) [[#254]](https://github.com/DeusExMachinaTeam/EM-CommunityPatch/pull/254)
* **Ignott - Lootboxes**: fixed the position of the 22th lootbox, which now spawns in the intended location [[#199]](https://github.com/DeusExMachinaTeam/EM-CommunityPatch/pull/199)
* **Ignott - Every dialogue with Oracle**: the player's truck is stopped on entering the Oracle's dialogue trigger zone, preventing it from ramming into the tower [[#199]](https://github.com/DeusExMachinaTeam/EM-CommunityPatch/pull/199)
* **Ignott - Bypass the Oracle Disciples**: fixed logic of the quest, now if the player decides to kill them, 'bypass' quest will be failed and the player will get a new 'kill' quest. They also initially have friendly dummy faction to separate them from bots driving around the map. Removed unnecessary dialogue line after the player killed the monster. Player can now make peace with OD by visiting he hermit druid, but this will only be available if option to kill them wasn't explicitly chosen in the dialogue [[#199]](https://github.com/DeusExMachinaTeam/EM-CommunityPatch/pull/199) [[#372]](https://github.com/DeusExMachinaTeam/EM-CommunityPatch/pull/372)
* **Ignott - Oracle's artifacts**: replaced heavy trigger rotating the artifacts on timer which manifested in jerky animation and leading to higher load on trigger execution logic, with an elegant smoothly animated artifacts [[#194]](https://github.com/DeusExMachinaTeam/EM-CommunityPatch/pull/194) [[#199]](https://github.com/DeusExMachinaTeam/EM-CommunityPatch/pull/199)
* **Argen - Quest 'Fight Axel'**: added Cyclops in the empty slot of Axel's Belaz. Player will not be able to leave the map after starting the fight to prevent softlock [[#249]](https://github.com/DeusExMachinaTeam/EM-CommunityPatch/pull/249) [[#254]](https://github.com/DeusExMachinaTeam/EM-CommunityPatch/pull/254)
* **Argen - Quest 'Win over Felix'**: player will not be able to leave the map after starting the fight to prevent softlock [[#254]](https://github.com/DeusExMachinaTeam/EM-CommunityPatch/pull/254)
* **Argen <-> Vahat transition**: player will be able to travel from Argen to Vahat after the first Vahat visit. A player will also be able to travel from Vahat to Argen after the first conversation with Vasiliy 'The Scientist'. Necessary cutscenes are also added [[#147]](https://github.com/DeusExMachinaTeam/EM-CommunityPatch/pull/147)
* **Disable automatic respawn of walking humans**: on three game maps logic of infinite respawn for walking humans was disabled. That mechanic was largely invisible, but created a huge risk of random game crashes(on stack oveflow) after new engine changes were made by ComPatch [[#429]](https://github.com/DeusExMachinaTeam/EM-CommunityPatch/pull/429)

### Text
* **Encyclopaedia**: proofreading and corrections for uidescription.xml [RU only] [[#64]](https://github.com/DeusExMachinaTeam/EM-CommunityPatch/pull/64) [[#74]](https://github.com/DeusExMachinaTeam/EM-CommunityPatch/pull/74)

* **Environment models**: giant rework of practically every standalone stone, crag and rock model in the game to patch holes in the geometry and improve models rendering and collisions. Collisions were also fixed for few other environment assets namely Stonehenge and factory cistern model [[#193]](https://github.com/DeusExMachinaTeam/EM-CommunityPatch/pull/193) [[#226]](https://github.com/DeusExMachinaTeam/EM-CommunityPatch/pull/226) [[#298]](https://github.com/DeusExMachinaTeam/EM-CommunityPatch/pull/298)
* **NPC**: for every regular NPC in the game textures and shaders were updated to align with the best available in the game, making these NPC to have the same quality as main characters in the game. Used originally unused textures on higher quality left by developers in game files, in other cases textures very upscaled [[#464]](https://github.com/DeusExMachinaTeam/EM-CommunityPatch/pull/464)
