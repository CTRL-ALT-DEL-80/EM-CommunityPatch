		value="We’ve been taking our vegetables to the Sowth’s market for years. I’m not a bad driver, but dad never let me go there on my own until today. But today is my birthday: I can do whatever I want! I bet my dad is preparing a surprise for me and wants me to be out of his way for now. Probably just as well!  " />

	<string
		id="r1_Yes_Lisa_History_01"
		value="I’ve had a strange encounter near the town. A good-looking girl asked me to help her. She could be from a gang, for all I know. But I agreed to help her, anyway, for I’ve been taught to trust people. There’s no harm in showing her around, is there?" />

	<string
		id="r1_No_Lisa_History_02"
		value="I’ve had a strange encounter near the town. A good-looking girl asked me to help her. She looked and acted like she was from a gang, so I refused to deliver some suspicious-looking package for her, but I just can’t get her out of my mind. What was my father going to tell me, I wonder? I’d better be going home now. " />

	<string
		id="r1_Three_Villages_00"
		value="What was my father going to tell me, I wonder? I’d better be going home now; I’ve stayed here way too long." />

	<string
		id="r1_First_Felix_Meet_00"
		value="Damn bandits! My truck was a hard target for them, battered as it may look. I’ve defeated Felix’s men, but I didn’t like the way they were threatening me…" />

	<string
		id="r1_After_Gloohoe_To_Ben_01"
		value="I noticed the smoke over my village from a distance. A terrible thing happened: somebody killed all the people and burnt the village to the ground. My father was dying, but before he passed away, he gave me what looked like a birthday gift. His last words were: “Find Ben Throttle!” I buried the dead people and went back to my truck. I opened the box and found dad’s savings, a sparkling object which looked like a disc and a sealed letter with my name on it. " />

	<string
		id="r1_After_Gloohoe_To_Felix_02"
		value="I noticed the smoke over my village from a distance. A terrible thing happened: somebody killed all the people and burnt the village to the ground. No one survived to tell me who’s done it and why. I bet it’s all Felix’s doing. I’m going to find him and kill him, whatever it may cost." />

	<string
		id="r1_After_Letter_00"
		value="The letter said I was adopted and my true father was an explorer, called Ivan Go. All that’s left from him is the truck I’m driving now and a mysterious CD. Ivan Go has gone missing several years ago and is probably dead by now. My world has just turned upside down. I need some time to make sense of it all and most of all, I need to find my father and ask him lots of questions. But first I have to talk to Ben Throttle." />

	<string
		id="r1_South_About_Felix_00"
		value="Turns out, Felix has been raiding this area for a while now. He’s made a sort of agreement with farmers: they pay him in return for “protection”. It worked well until the holocaust in Glukhoe. Most people are too frightened to stand up against Felix, but with the weapon I got now, I can destroy his lair. " />

	<string
		id="r1_Before_Ben_00"
		value="I’ve never traveled so far before. I haven’t realized there are other villages besides my own. Anyway, I found Ben’s hut at last.  " />

	<string
		id="r1_After_Ben_00"
		value="The old man saw the familiar features in me and gave me a warm welcome. His house was full of strange objects. When I told him my story, he said my father has been gone for over 20 years. He found something important but didn’t want to tell anyone about it until he made sure it was safe. Ben told me a little about my father and his research. When I showed him the disk, he recalled that my dad had a machine that could read and write such things, as if they were books. He gave me directions to my father’s house." />

	<string
		id="r1_Kill_Felix_00"
		value="The bandits' base lies in ruins, Felix has fled with his tail between his legs. He didn’t kill my father, so I decided to keep his life. He may be evil, but who am I to judge him? The men who destroyed Glukhoe had far greater powers than Felix’s gang. The only witness of that holocaust is Lisa, the girl from the North. I’ll have to find her and hear the truth.  " />

	<string
		id="r1_Father_Room_00"
		value="The word “strange” doesn’t even begin to describe my father’s dwelling. All those sophisticated gadgets were just a heap of junk to me, for I didn’t know how to use them. All the machines seemed to be out of order. The humid air that penetrated the house through broken windows and roof is probably the reason. One thing drew my attention – a Charm of unusual shape, which I found when a board cracked underneath my feet.  " />

	<string
		id="r1_About_Lisa_After_Base_00"
		value="The girl is not as simple as she lets on. She’s hanging out with bandits. I have a bad feeling about her. I’ve traveled so many miles after her and I’m beginning to understand what kind of bird she is." />

	<string
		id="r1_Dialod_With_Lisa_00"
		value="How could I ever doubt the poor creature? She was frightened and looking for help. Lisa told me about Axel Argen’s  tyranny and his plans to spread his influence to the east. My village was the first settlement on their way. I won’t rest until I have my revenge. I’ll get Axel, whatever it takes. " />

	<string
		id="r1_See_Tonnel_00"
		value="The mercenaries use the tunnel, which starts near Asgard. I bet locals cooperate with the bandits and get their interest from arms traffic." />

	<string
		id="r2_After_Tonnel_00"
		value="I got the key to the tunnel door and after several hours’ driving I found myself in a strange place. " />

	<string
		id="r2_Find_Lisa_00"
		value="The people here are far less civilized than my fellow-villagers. However, I learned some interesting things from them: that Lisa is Axel’s assistant. Axel is the leader of a gang based in Argen. |The gang is called ‘Scarlet Dawn’, and they sound dangerous. They’ve declared war against Librium and that’s just a part of their ambitious plans. I’m not so sure I can fight against them all on my own." />

	<string
		id="r2_Find_Axel_00"
		value="The people here are far less civilized than my fellow-villagers. Probably just as well: it will be easier to get to Axel unnoticed.|Turns out they have a government here, which is at war with the neighbor state. The trouble is, Axel is the leader of that state and is obviously well-guarded. I’ll have to use my brain to get to him." />

	<string
		id="r2_SNG_00"
		value="I joined the CIT, the Commonwealth of Independent Towns – that’s what Librium people call themselves. I think they are fighting for a noble cause. Besides, we have a common enemy. Axel." />

	<string
		id="r2_AR_00"
		value="The best way to get to Axel is probably to join his Scarlet Dawn Army. I’ll gain the commander’s respect and get presented for reward. That’ll be my chance to kill Axel." />

	<string
		id="r2_Before_Axel_00"
		value="That was a hell of a war. It wasn’t always direct, but it was always destructive. And I had to do things I’m probably going to regret. But I don’t have time for that now that Axel is in my hands." />

	<string
		id="r2_After_Axel_01"
		value="I had a major disappointment after I defeated the Scarlet Dawn leader. I expected to meet a barbarian and a cruel murderer, but I actually saw an educated man, who’s concerned about the future of the humankind. And even though I couldn’t accept his methods, I sort of liked him. Besides, he wasn’t to blame for all those crimes Lisa accused him of. Turns out she fooled both of us. She’ll pay for it." />

	<string
		id="r2_After_Axel_02"
		value="I had a major disappointment after I defeated the Scarlet Dawn leader. I expected to meet a barbarian and a cruel murderer, but I actually saw an educated man, who’s concerned about the future of the humankind. Even though I couldn’t accept his methods, I sort of liked him. It turned out Lisa kept him in the dark about her actions." />

	<string
		id="r2_Lisa_After_Axel_01"
		value="With my reputation of the liberator all I had to do was ask the right people and they told me where to look for Lisa. She jumped into her truck as soon as she saw me, and it was only when she realized that her truck was no match against mine, that she gave in and agreed to answer my questions." />

	<string
		id="r2_Lisa_After_Axel_02"
		value="Now that I became a hero of Librium, it wasn’t hard to track Lisa down and talk to her. It turned out, that she was looking for Ivan Go, the famous explorer, who’s gone missing many years ago. Her investigation led her to my native village, but it was too late: some people came from the Death Desert and destroyed all evidence. " />

	<string
		id="r2_With_Lisa_To_Oracul_01"
		value="I’m gonna get the murderers even if I have to go to the edge of the world for them. But no one has ever survived in the Death Desert before. They say that the Northern Isle Oracle knows answers to all questions, so we’ll visit it with Lisa. Yes, she’s joined me and she’s got a disc with important information about Ivan Go. Lisa is looking for a way to read it, but with no luck so far.    " />

	<string
		id="r1_Before_Desert_00"
		value="Midgard masters agreed to make the device for me, but they needed certain tools for it. They weren’t hard to find and soon enough I had a truck that could travel in the desert. " />

	<string
		id="r1_Lisa_Thief_00"
		value="My joy didn’t last. Lisa has stolen both discs and the key to the Sea Gates! Her tracks lead to the West. I’ll follow her and ask her why she took the objects that had no value to anyone but me." />

	<string
		id="r1_After_Boss1"
		value="I've never heard about the monsters I faced today on the way to the Sea Gates. I was this close to getting smashed by their guard, but in the end I destroyed it!  " />

	<string
		id="r3_After_WaterGate_1"
		value="When I reached the beach I saw the Sea Gates at once. It’s a grand construction on the edge of the firm ground. I approached it and lifted the Charm above my head, which felt warmer for some reason. The next thing I saw was a giant fish coming to the surface. The fish opened its mouth which looked big enough for two trucks to fit in, and froze as if inviting me to drive in. Terrified, I drove inside… The mouth closed and I heard a loud splash as the monster dived back into the sea depths.|The monster turned out to be a huge mechanism, like my truck." />

	<string
		id="r3_JustGo_1"
		value="The region was truly exotic: huge trees and humid air stirred primal instincts in me." />

	<string
		id="r3_Fist_Fight_1"
		value="The only road through the jungle led me to a small settlement. The locals opened fire at me the moment they saw me, so I had to turn back and look for a more hospitable village.| Luckily, I found it soon enough. The people of the other village gave me a warm welcome and offered an alliance against the aggressive Druids.   " />

	<string
		id="r3_Uluk_LureDruid"
		value="I didn’t like the idea of an ambush, but I agreed to help the villagers nonetheless. In return for my help, the Machine-cultists showed me the way to the Oracle." />

	<string
		id="r3_Uluk_NoLureDruid"
		value="I refused to take part in their bloody plan, so I headed towards the forest capital – Seth. " />

	<string
		id="r3_Fist_Friendly"
		value="The only road through the jungle led me to a small settlement. The locals were rather hostile to begin with, but we sorted it out in the end. It turns out that only the High Druid from Seth knows the way to the Oracle, so I set off towards Seth." />

	<string
		id="r3_Set_HelpMainDruid_1"
		value="The High Druid set a difficult task for me, but a few steel monsters couldn’t stop me. However, it took me a while to complete his task and learn the Oracle’s location.  " />

	<string
		id="r3_Oracle_FirstTime"
		value="When we talked about the Oracle, I expected to see a hermit’s hut at the top of the mountain, but what I saw was so different from the stories about wizards and sages… It was a bunch of towers linked by passages, emitting energy. A monster was confined inside the golden cage by the warriors of the past. That’s how I first met the Oracle." />

	<string
		id="r3_Oracle_HelpHim_1"
		value="The Oracle asked for a favor in return for information. I couldn’t but agree. " />

	<string
		id="r3_Oracle_DecodeDisc1"
		value="The Oracle agreed to read the disc if I carry out certain rituals. Fair enough, I thought. And besides, the island was full of interesting places." />

	<string
		id="r3_Oracle_NeedDisc2"
		value="I was so excited when the Oracle took the disc: I was finally going to hear my father’s message! But I had a major disappointment when the Oracle announced: ‘Insert disc #2’! But I only had one! Of which I immediately informed the Oracle, barely able to keep from cursing. I couldn’t believe it! Were all my efforts vain? The Oracle asked me impassively where I got the disc from and what I was trying to find out with its help. He told me to look for the second disc among my father’s things. My first impulse was to search the old truck my father left me." />

	<string
		id="r3_Oracle_BringDisc2"
		value="With the disc and the Charm in my bag, I visited the Oracle again. My father’s message was finally deciphered! At long last I heard my father’s voice… He was talking about his life and research. Most importantly I learned that he was traveling across the desert in search of an important device. It must have been something secret, since my dad hid his diary so well. I realized that my dad wanted me to hear these words and to know where he was heading, in case he couldn’t come back. I must find him! " />

	<string
		id="r3_v2_Uluk_FirstTime_1"
		value="The only road through the jungle led me to a small settlement. The locals gave me a warm welcome and offered an alliance against the aggressive Druids." />

	<string
		id="r3_v2_LisaDisc1"
		value="The Oracle couldn’t decipher Lisa’s disc, but he told me that there was a design of a gadget that could help me cross the desert. " />

	<string
		id="r3_v2_BringDisc2"
		value="With both discs in my hands, I returned to the Oracle and deciphered Ivan’s diary. I just need to collect all the necessary things for traveling across the desert. " />

	<string
		id="r4_AfterSomeTimeTravel"
		value="After several day’s driving under the scorching sun and sandy wind, I could hardly believe my eyes when I saw the clay buildings of Oasia.|You never know what to expect from these people – now they are nice, the next moment they want to stab you in the back. And the strangest thing is that they can’t give coherent answers to any of my questions. It looks like they've lost their memory." />

	<string
		id="r4_KnownAboutBuhara"
		value="I found out that there is a village of the Memory Keepers nearby – that’s what they call their elders. I’ve got to go there and find somebody who can help me. I wonder, what happened here… This place looks like it survived a major cataclysm." />

	<string
		id="r4_FindBuhara"
		value="With great difficulty I got the directions to the Keepers’ village. The place was well hidden in the desert among the old ships, which made me wonder: who are the elders hiding from? " />

	<string
		id="r4_TalkWithBuhares"
		value="My visit caused panic among Bukhara population. It was only when the Memory Keepers realized that I didn’t mean harm that they told me their sad story:| Many years ago some mysterious madness seized the people of local villages. They started killing each other, and worst of all, they had no memory of what they had done afterwards. For some particular reason Bukhara elders were immune to that madness, but they lived in constant fear of an attack. It came as a shock to me that there were no mysterious monsters, but ordinary people were killing each other and destroying their own houses." />

	<string
		id="r4_AfterAtackToBuhars"
		value="Now I understood why the elders tried so hard to hide their village. People in tanks arrived soon after me and opened fire at Bukhara. I couldn’t let them kill innocent people! I remembered too well what happened to my own village. I fought until we destroyed the last tank and then helped to evacuate the elders on a ship. In return they told me that a man who fit the description of my father had once passed their village. He was heading the south-east. I’ll follow him!" />

	<string
		id="r4_LisaBecameCrazy"
		value="Lisa was acting really strange: she was nervous for no apparent reason and eventually opened fire at me. It was a major test for my patience. I realized that she was no traitor; it was just the effect the place had on her.| On arrival to Bukhara Lisa blacked out, so I thought she would be better off with the elders, who were heading to the main land. Ben will take care of her. I will continue my search. " />

	<string
		id="r4_FindFatherCar"
		value="I found an armored truck in the sands, heavily damaged in combat. There was no body inside, but I found a jacket with my father’s name on it. He’s been there! Looks like he’s left the truck and continued his journey on foot.| I took a few gadgets from the car – they were too good to be left here. They will remind me of my father. I’m sure I’m on the right way now. " />

	<string
		id="r4_AfterMilitaryBase"
		value="Nothing prepared me for the encounter with the army of madmen. I was saved from the imminent death by unexpected allies. Science settlement, lost in the middle of the desert, and its master made a strange impression on me. " />

	<string
		id="r4_NearTarelka"
		value="Crossing the next dune, I saw a terrible sight: many people were standing motionless around a huge metal mountain. I couldn’t say whether they were dead or alive. I didn’t know why they gathered here but I felt, that Ivan Go was one of them. No one answered my cries and signals. The feeling of great sorrow came upon me. " />

	<string
		id="r4_AfterTarelka"
		value="I could feel the power coming from the center of the human circle, calling me to join the majority. I managed to resist it and return to the settlement. Here I learned about the catastrophe that destroyed the ancient world and its causes.  Humans should not play with the things beyond their understanding! Now the extraterrestrial mechanism, launched by the Scientist keeps working and poisoning my planet.| There must be a way to stop this madness. It seems that Ivan Go has already seen the alien mechanisms somewhere before. I should speak with his friend, Ben Throttle, about it." />

	<string
		id="r1_Before_Fight_Aliens"
		value="My eyes are open. Evil alien invaders are terraforming our planet with the help of the huge device, I found in the desert. But their main base is somewhere around Seil, a town in the Librium. Its radiation jams the Oracle’s signals. If I destroy the base, my mechanical ally will take control over the orbital weapon and commit nuclear strikes that will stop the invasion for good!  " />

	<string
		id="r2_Before_Fight_Oracle"
		value="I met one of the aliens, Njeri, as they call themselves. Now I now what really happened in the past. As a result of a series of unfortunate events, the device that was supposed to only work in outer space was turned on the surface of our planet. It constantly deals tremendous harm to the planet and its inhabitants and even Njeri cannot approach it. However, I visited that place and survived! Now my goal is to put several devices that the aliens gave me around the desert spaceship to stop it." />

Here I learned about the catastrophe that destroyed the ancient world and its causes.  Human should not play with the things beyond their understanding! Now the extraterrestrial mechanism, launched by the Scientist keeps working and poisoning my planet.| I must destroy this place along with its horrors and mysteries. The Oracle must know where to find a weapon powerful enough." />

	<string
