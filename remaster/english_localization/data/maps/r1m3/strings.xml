Its metal servants have retreated to the jungle and launch occasional surprise raids on Njeri's expeditions. The successful installation of the jammer caused a noticeable change in the lives of humans. The alien base moved to Zarmek, where they were finally able to safely study the emission and its effects on humans. The first experiments were quite successful: some people managed to take off their masks and survive. However, only within the walls of Njeri's laboratory. For the first time in many years, people had hope for the revival of the old world. But the shrewd ones began to realize that the falling of the saucer was not accidental, and the plans of the new allies may be very different from the people's aspirations."
